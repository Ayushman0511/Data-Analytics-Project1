## üìñ Overview 
In any Data Science project the most crucial step is Data Analytics, which helps in understanding the data, identify patters, and uncover insights that might not be immediately apparent. This is why this project includes Data Analytics in 2 phases `Exloratory Data Analytics` and `Advanced Data Analytics`.

- **Exploratory Data Analytics(EDA):**  It focuses on Database, Dimension, Date and Measures Exploration & understanding the Magnitude and Rankings of the data. Scripts `01 - 07` focuses on **EDA**.
- **Advanced Analytics:** It contains advanced analytical SQL Queries for analysing Change-Over-Time, Cumulative Analysis, Performanse Analysis, Part-to-Whole Proportionality, Data Segmentation and Reporting. Scripts `08 - 13` includes **Advanced Analytics**.
